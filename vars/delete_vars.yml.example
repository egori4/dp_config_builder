# delete_vars.yml.example - Template for deleting network class variables
# Copy this file to delete_vars.yml and customize with your environment details


########################### Target DefensePro Devices ######################
# Target DefensePro devices - add or remove IP addresses as needed
dp_ip:
  - "10.105.192.32"
  # - "10.105.192.33"
  # - "10.105.192.34"


########################## Network Class Deletions ##########################
# Define the network class groups to delete
# To get the list of network classes to delete and their indices, use the get_network_class module first
delete_networks:
  # Example: Delete specific network groups from "egor_test_net"
  - {class_name: "egor_test_net", index: 0}
  - {class_name: "egor_test_net", index: 1}  
  - {class_name: "egor_test_net", index: 2}
  - {class_name: "egor_test_net", index: 3}
  
  # Example: Delete from different network classes
  # - {class_name: "web_servers", index: 0}
  # - {class_name: "database_servers", index: 0}

# Network Class Deletion Notes:
# - class_name: The name of the network class containing the group to delete
# - index: The sub-index of the network group within the class (as integer)
# - Use get_network_class module to discover existing classes and their current indices
# - The playbook will delete all combinations of dp_ip Ã— delete_networks
# - Deletion is permanent - ensure you have backups if needed


########################## Connection Limit Deletions ##########################
# For connection limit profile and protection deletions, see sections below
# Use delete_cl_profiles.yml playbook for these operations

# Connection Limit Profile Deletions #############################
# OPTIONAL: Remove protections from profiles (without deleting the protection itself)
# Note: When the last protection is removed from a profile, the profile is automatically deleted

cl_profile_deletions:
  - profile_name: "cl_prof_egor_test10"
    protections:
      - "cl_prot_egor_test11"
      - "cl_prot_egor_test12"
  
  # - profile_name: "another_profile"
  #   protections:
  #     - "protection_to_remove"

# Connection Limit Protection Deletions ##########################
# OPTIONAL: Delete protections entirely (protection must not be in any profile)
# Important: Protection cannot be deleted if it's still associated with any profile

# The format supporting both names (strings) and indexes (integers)
cl_protection_deletions:
  - protections_to_delete:
      - "cl_prot_egor_test10"    # Delete by name (module will look up index)
      - "cl_prot_egor_test11"    # Delete by name (module will look up index)
      - 450156                   # Delete by index directly
      - 450157                   # Delete by index directly

# Connection Limit Deletion Notes 
# 1. Both sections (cl_profile_deletions and cl_protection_deletions) are OPTIONAL
# 2. You can define one, another or both
# 3. Order matters: Remove protections from profiles BEFORE deleting the protections themselves
# 4. Profile deletion is automatic when last protection is removed
# 5. Protection deletion: Support both names (strings) and indexes (integers) in the same list
#    - Names: Module automatically fetches current protections to map names to indexes  
#    - Indexes: Used directly for deletion

# Connection Limit Usage Patterns
# Pattern 1: Remove protections from profiles only (keep protections for reuse)
# - Define only cl_profile_deletions section
# - Skip cl_protection_deletions section

# Pattern 2: Delete protections entirely (must not be in any profile)
# - Define only cl_protection_deletions section  
# - Skip cl_profile_deletions section

# Pattern 3: Complete cleanup (remove from profiles AND delete protections)
# - Define both sections
# - Module will process profile deletions first, then protection deletions

# Pattern 4: Mixed operations
# - Remove some protections from profiles
# - Delete other standalone protections
# - Define both sections with different protection names


########################## Security Policy Deletions ########################
# Define security policies to delete
# Two deletion modes supported:
# 1. "policy_only" - Delete only the security policy (default, safer)
# 2. "policy_and_profiles" - Delete policy and attempt cleanup of associated profiles

delete_security_policies:
  # Example: Simple policy deletion (recommended for most cases)
  - policy_name: "test_security_policy"           # MANDATORY: Policy name to delete
    deletion_mode: "policy_only"                  # OPTIONAL: Default deletion mode
  
  # Example: Complex deletion with profile cleanup
  - policy_name: "old_security_policy"           # MANDATORY: Policy name to delete
    deletion_mode: "policy_and_profiles"          # OPTIONAL: Also attempts profile cleanup(if not in use by other policies)
  
  # Example: Using default deletion mode (policy_only)
  # - policy_name: "another_policy"               # deletion_mode defaults to "policy_only"

# Security Policy Deletion Notes:
# - policy_name: MANDATORY - Must be an existing security policy name
# - deletion_mode: OPTIONAL - Controls deletion behavior:
#   * "policy_only" (default): Simple DELETE on policy endpoint
#   * "policy_and_profiles": Uses complex deletion endpoint that may clean up profiles
#
