# delete_vars.yml.example - Template for deleting network class variables
# Copy this file to delete_vars.yml and customize with your environment details

# Target DefensePro devices - add or remove IP addresses as needed
dp_ip:
  - "10.105.192.32"
  # - "10.105.192.33"
  # - "10.105.192.34"

# Define the network class groups to delete
# To get the list of network classes to delete and their indices, use the get_network_class module first
delete_networks:
  # Example: Delete specific network groups from "egor_test_net"
  - {class_name: "egor_test_net", index: 0}
  - {class_name: "egor_test_net", index: 1}  
  - {class_name: "egor_test_net", index: 2}
  - {class_name: "egor_test_net", index: 3}
  
  # Example: Delete from different network classes
  # - {class_name: "web_servers", index: 0}
  # - {class_name: "database_servers", index: 0}

# Notes:
# - class_name: The name of the network class containing the group to delete
# - index: The sub-index of the network group within the class (as integer)
# - Use get_network_class module to discover existing classes and their current indices
# - The playbook will delete all combinations of dp_ip Ã— delete_networks
# - Deletion is permanent - ensure you have backups if needed
