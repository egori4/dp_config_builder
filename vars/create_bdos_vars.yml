# Notes:
# - name: Must be unique BDOS profile name per DefensePro
# - params: Keys must match supported API fields for BDOS
# - All values are strings (quote them), even numbers
# - The playbook will create all combinations of dp_ip Ã— bdos_profiles
# - You can duplicate the "params" block to define multiple profiles
