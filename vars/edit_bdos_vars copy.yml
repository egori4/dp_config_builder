# edit_bdos_vars.yml.example - Template for editing BDOS Flood profile variables
# Copy this file to edit_bdos_vars.yml and customize with your environment details

# Target DefensePro devices - add or remove IP addresses as needed

  #     Rate Limit: "disable"
  #     Packet Report Status: "enable"
  #     Packet Trace Status: "enable"

# Notes:
# - name: Must match an existing BDOS profile on DefensePro
# - params: Keys must match supported API fields for BDOS
# - All values are strings (quote them), even numbers
# - The playbook will edit all combinations of dp_ip Ã— bdos_edits
# - Use get_bdos_profile module to verify existing profiles before editing
